Repository to host the Final Project for the AMATH584: Applied Linear Algebra and Introductory Numerical Analysis class taught in the University of Washington Applied Mathematics Department. The overarching focus of the course was on the solution of the linear system: Ax = b. Basic applied linear algebra concepts like inner products and hermitian conjugates were reviewed alongside some of the properties associated with over-/under-determined, square, symmetric, and Hermitian matrices. The SVD, LU, and QR matrix decompositions were introduced. The last part of the course focused on connections with machine learning and data science. 

This assignment demanded the use of supervised learning techniques applied to the popular machine learning MNIST database in order to measure and interpret the most important pixels involved in the task of classifying which digit the handwritten character of a particular image represented. My solution was to use the sklearn implementation of the LASSO method  and then perform an average across the training set predictions to decide what the ten most significant pixels were. Due to time constraints an analysis of the generalization and test error was not performed although any (unlikely) future extension of the work would begin by addressing this matter.
